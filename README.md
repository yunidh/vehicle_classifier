# Vehicle Classification Model 
Experimenting various methods to create vehicle classifier using Pytorch for an Intelligent Parking System named Superveyes.

The final vehicle classification model was used in conjunction with a NPR(Number Plate Recognition) model to create a Python desktop application.
The idea for this application was to create a parking system that could:
<ul>
<li>automatically detect the type of vehicle</li>
<li>read its number plate</li>
<li>designate parking space for it automatically.</li>
</ul>
